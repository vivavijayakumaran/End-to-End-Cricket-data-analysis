# End_to_end_cricket_analysis_project
This project focuses on creating a personalized cricket team based on the players previous performnaces. Using various data analysis tools such as Power BI, the previous data of the players can be analysed and comapred with other players. Based on the data we got from Esporta and other platforms, the performances are well analysed. With the help of guidance from a youtube channel, we were able to finiush the project successfully.
